# Technical Insights from Studii SAT Prep App Development

## Architecture and Design Patterns

### Client-Server Responsibility Separation
One of the most impactful architectural decisions was clearly separating client and server responsibilities. By moving time-sensitive operations like session tracking to the database layer using PostgreSQL functions, we achieved more accurate and reliable data while reducing client-side complexity.

### Hybrid Rendering Approach
The application benefits significantly from a hybrid rendering approach:
- **Server Components**: Handle data fetching, authentication, and initial page loads
- **Client Components**: Manage interactive UI elements that require frequent state updates

This pattern provides the best of both worlds: SEO-friendly content with server components and responsive interactions with client components.

## Session Management Insights

### Database-Driven Time Tracking
Moving time tracking logic from the client to PostgreSQL functions revealed several advantages:
- Consistent timestamps regardless of client-side clock accuracy
- Reliable session duration calculations even with network interruptions
- Simplified client code by removing time calculation responsibilities

### Graceful Session Completion
Implementing multiple layers of session completion protection taught me the importance of defensive programming:
- Using `navigator.sendBeacon()` for reliable data transmission during page unload
- Creating dedicated lightweight API endpoints for specific use cases
- Implementing fallback mechanisms for edge cases

This approach ensures data integrity even in unpredictable browser environments.

## React and Next.js Patterns

### State Management Optimization
The quiz interface implementation demonstrated the importance of thoughtful state management:
- Using `useCallback` for functions passed to effect dependencies
- Properly structuring dependency arrays in `useEffect` hooks
- Balancing between prop drilling and context for state sharing

These practices significantly improved component performance and maintainability.

### Server Actions vs. API Routes
Working with Next.js 13+ App Router revealed the tradeoffs between server actions and API routes:
- **Server Actions**: Ideal for authenticated, standard operations with tight component integration
- **API Routes**: Better for specialized endpoints with unique requirements (like beacon requests)

This hybrid approach provides flexibility while maintaining code organization.

## User Experience Considerations

### Non-Blocking Operations
Implementing session tracking taught me to prioritize non-blocking operations:
- Avoiding confirmation dialogs when not necessary
- Using asynchronous operations for background tasks
- Ensuring UI remains responsive during data operations

These practices create a smoother, more app-like experience for users.

### Progressive Enhancement
The application implements progressive enhancement by:
- Ensuring core functionality works even if JavaScript fails
- Providing graceful fallbacks for features like session tracking
- Handling edge cases like network interruptions or page unloads

This approach makes the application more resilient and accessible to all users.

## Database Design Insights

### Function-Based Database Logic
Moving business logic to database functions provided several benefits:
- Centralized data validation and processing
- Reduced network traffic between client and server
- Improved security through `SECURITY DEFINER` functions

This pattern is particularly valuable for operations that require atomic transactions or precise timing.

### Optimistic Updates
Implementing optimistic UI updates while ensuring data consistency taught me to:
- Update the UI immediately for perceived performance
- Queue background synchronization with the server
- Handle conflict resolution when server and client states diverge

This pattern significantly improves perceived performance while maintaining data integrity.

## Testing and Monitoring Considerations

### Edge Case Testing
The session tracking implementation highlighted the importance of testing edge cases:
- Browser navigation behaviors (back button, refresh, tab close)
- Network interruptions during critical operations
- Concurrent operations from multiple tabs or devices

These scenarios often reveal subtle bugs that wouldn't appear in standard testing.

### Telemetry and Logging
Implementing proper logging for session tracking revealed the value of:
- Structured logging for easier analysis
- Capturing context with each log entry
- Distinguishing between expected and unexpected failures

This approach makes troubleshooting much more efficient in production environments.
