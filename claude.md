# Claude Development Log - Studii SAT Prep Application

## June 26, 2025: Question Fetching Refactoring

### Objective
Refactor and simplify the SAT practice question fetching logic by:
- Removing legacy and backward compatibility code
- Updating database queries to use current schema fields
- Ensuring consistent naming across the codebase
- Fixing TypeScript errors related to schema mismatches

### Changes Made

#### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Updated Question and QuestionInsert interfaces to match actual database schema:
  - Renamed `difficulty_level` to `difficulty`
  - Renamed `sat_score_band` to `difficulty_band`
  - Added direct `domain_id` and `subject_id` fields

#### 2. Function Consolidation
- Removed legacy function `getLegacyQuestionsForPractice()`
- Simplified `getQuestionsForPractice()` to use only current schema fields
- Updated `getQuestionsBySkill()` to remove deprecated parameters
- Removed `randomOrder` parameter as it's no longer supported

#### 3. SQL Stored Procedure Updates
- Fixed `get_random_practice_questions` PostgreSQL function to use correct column names
- Changed filtering from `difficulty_level` and `difficulty_letter` to `difficulty_band`
- Improved error handling to throw errors instead of falling back to legacy functions

#### 4. Type System Improvements
- Exported `QuizQuestion` and `QuizOption` interfaces from quiz-interface component
- Updated question variable typing in practice page
- Fixed fallback question generation to match current `QuizQuestion` type

#### 5. Database Field Consistency
- Updated all references to `difficulty_level` to use `difficulty` instead:
  - In `searchQuestions()` function
  - In `importSATQuestion()` function
  - In `getQuestionStats()` function
  - In `getDetailedSkillStats()` function
  - In practice page question mapping

### Benefits
- Simplified codebase with fewer redundant functions
- Improved type safety with consistent field naming
- Better error handling with explicit errors instead of silent fallbacks
- More maintainable code with direct field references instead of legacy mappings
- Fixed PostgreSQL errors related to missing columns

### Next Steps
- Run tests to verify the consolidated question fetching works correctly
- Monitor for any runtime errors or unexpected behavior
- Consider fixing remaining implicit any type errors in quiz-interface components
